# Calculation of the TSE score

The TSE score is a transcriptomic marker that correlates with response to ICIs. The study reported by Rijnders, Nakauma-Gonzalez, et al., is available as [preprint at bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.30.493997). It has been submitted for publication and it is under review.

This R script calculates the TSE score from normalized counts. It can be applied to any data set. The data set has to be a Matrix with samples as columns and gene names as rows.
